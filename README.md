# FishVM

Barebones frontend for Apple's `Virtualization.framework`. Heavy work in progress.

## Notes

- The virtualized OS must match your host's architecture (i.e. aarch64 for Apple Silicon, x86_64 for Intel)
- Stopping VMs is broken (see TODOs)

## TODO: 

- Get stopping VMs to work
- Suspend VMs
- Multiple running VMs
- macOS Guests (very unlikely, I do not own any Apple Silicon Macs)
